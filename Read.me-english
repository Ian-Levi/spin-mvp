# 🚀 SPIN – The platform for young founders

**SPIN** is a digital platform designed to support young, first-time entrepreneurs in building their projects.  
We provide continuous guidance, professional mentorship, and access to funding opportunities, events, and resources in the startup ecosystem.

## 🌍 What problem does SPIN solve?

Many aspiring founders face similar challenges:

- Lack of funding or resources  
- Little to no knowledge about startups and business development  
- No network or supportive environment  
- No tools to track progress or structure their work  
- Difficulty finding trustworthy feedback or mentorship

Meanwhile, investors and mentors struggle to find well-prepared early-stage projects worth supporting.

**SPIN bridges this gap.**
